# Antiquarian

Antiquarian web application. This project aims to create a shared database system (referred to as "Keskusdivari" in Finnish) that centralizes and facilitates the operations of multiple second-hand bookshops ("divarit" in Finnish). These bookshops typically sell used books or surplus editions from publishers and are increasingly moving towards online sales. By implementing this shared platform, individual bookshops can manage their inventory, allow customers to search for books across multiple shops, and process orders efficiently.

Developed as a coursework for TUNI DATA.DB.210 Database programming -course.
